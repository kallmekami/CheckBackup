# CheckBackup
 This Bash script checks WHM/cPanel backup files for common issues before restoration. It verifies file existence, checks permissions, ensures sufficient disk space, confirms file integrity, and checks that MySQL/MariaDB service is running. Use it to identify and resolve potential problems with your backup files.
